# Introduction

1. What is spatiotemporal data?
1. What is involved in data analysis?
1. How do we analyse data?
1. What is data science? Is geoinformatics a data science?
1. What is [R](https://www.r-project.org/)? 
1. Why do we use 
    - R?
    - [R-markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)?
	- [GitHub](https://github.com/)?

# 1. Time series

1. What characterizes time series data? When is data _not_ time series data?
1. Which different types of time series data can you think of?

# 2. Exercise:

* Bring two different time series data sets to class, on Thursday

## Computer exercises (studlab 125)

For those *unfamiliar* with R (note that this is a lot of work!):

1. Start R
1. Open http://www.r-project.org/ in a browser
1. Browse to Documentation: Manuals
1. Open: An Introduction to R
1. Work your way through chapters 1-9.
1. If you have time left, work your way through the exercises below:

## Pen and paper exercises:

For the following data:

```{r}
x = c(1,2,4,5)
y = c(2,1,5,4)
data.frame(x,y)
plot(x,y)
```

## Review questions:

1. How is the mean for a random variable $X$ defined?
1. Give the equation for covariance between two variables $x$ and $y$
1. Give the equation for correlation between two variables $x$ and $y$
1. For the samples $x$ and $y$, compute the sample mean, the variance and the standard deviation 
1. Draw the data in a scatter plot (by hand)
1. From the table above, compute the covariance between $x$ and $y$, and the correlation between $x$ and $y$
1. Suppose $x$ is a time series data, and the rows indicating the time index. Compute the lag 0, lag 1 and lag 2 autocorrelations of $x$.
1. What is the general equation of an autoregressive AR(p) process?
1. What is the general equation of a moving average MA(q) process?
1. Up to which lag is an AR(p) process correlated?
1. Up to which lag is a MA(q) process correlated?
1. What can be said about partial correlations of an AR(2) process?
