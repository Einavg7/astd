# Time series: frequency domain

Frequency domain time series looks at recurring elements. These are e.g.
caused by:
* astronomical processes
  * sun: day-night: temperature, tides
  * sun: yearly: phenological, plant physiology
  * moon: tidal variations
* social
  * week, months (?)
* biological: 
  * heartbeat, blood pressure
* vibration:
  * two flowing media: waves (wind-water), ripples (wind-sand, water-sand)
  * musical instruments
* other
  * anything that turns, or walks

To review: Trigonometry, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry

The angle transformation formula is given here:

$$\sin(A \pm B) = \sin A \cos B \pm \cos A \sin B$$

In case of a function of time $t$, shifted with a phase shift $\phi$:

$$ f(t) = sin(t + \phi) = \sin t \cos \phi + \cos t \sin \phi = a \sin t + b \cos t$$

with $a = \cos \phi$ and $b = \sin \phi$

Try the following code:
```{r eval=FALSE}
x = seq(0, 4*pi, length.out = 200) # x plotting range

f = function(dir, x) { # plot the combination of a sin+cos function, based on dir
	a = sin(dir)
	b = cos(dir)
	# three curves:
	plot(a * sin(x) + b * cos(x) ~ x, type = 'l', asp=1, col = 'green')
	lines(x, a * sin(x), col = 'red')
	lines(x, b * cos(x), col = 'blue')
	# legend:
	lines(c(10, 10+a), c(2,2), col = 'red')
	lines(c(10, 10), c(2,2+b), col = 'blue')
	arrows(x0 = 10, x1 = 10+a, y0 = 2, y1 = 2+b, .1, col = 'green')
	title("red: sin(x), blue: cos(x), green: sum")
}

for (d in seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)) {
	f(d, x)
	Sys.sleep(.1) # give us some time to think this over!
}
```
