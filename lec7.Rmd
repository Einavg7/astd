# assignment; areal/lattice data

## assignment WS 2016/17

The assignment is to carry out a spatio-temporal analysis on a
dataset of your choice, using one of the methods that we dealt with
during the course so far, or another (after approval), and report
on this.

The report shall:

* have 1000-2000 words of free text (i.e., excluding the script)
* be structured like a short scientific report (introduction, data, methods, results, discussion and conclusion, list of references)
* state in the introduction clearly the research question (or hypothesis)
* be submitted as a .zip file with the report in an R-Markdown file (or similar), but in any case include the data, and be easily reproducible, as well as in final form (typically, .html)
* the analysis shall be part of the text flow, figures (and/or tables) shall support the discussion and conclusions
* the reference list shall include at least three pieces of related work
* each of the works listed in the references shall be referred to in the main text
* be written in scientific style
* be kept simple

## Areal / lattice data.

For typical lattice data, observed values are associated with
areas, and the union of the areas observed cover the region of
interest. The boundaries of the areas do not follow from the observed
phenomen's properties, but typically from external constraints to
the observation process.

Examples include:

* socio-economic data, related to administrative regions (census, administration)
* health data, related to hospital wards, or aggregated to adm. regions
* satellite imagery (aggregates, related to pixels)
* climate model predictions, as aggregates over regions

Problems include:

* areal interpolation: interpolate (downscale/upscale) the observed values to some other units, that are hierchically related to the current areal units (e.g. landsat/modis, change of administrative regions, integration of health and census data)
* evaluating models (testing hypothesis) expressed as $y = X\beta + e$, where either $y$ and/or $e$ exhibit autocorrelation


Typical analysis (see R package `spdep`) follows a path:

* build, and evaluate a spatial weight matrix (based on neighbours, or distance, or both)
* test for spatial correlation using Moran's I
* give significant spatial correlation, build models that account for that

Models used:
* simultaneous autoregressive models (asdar 2nd ed, 9.4.1.1)
* conditional autoregressive models (asdar 2nd ed, 9.4.1.2)
