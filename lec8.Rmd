# Movement

Movement is an inherently spatio-temporal phenomenon: position
(of something) moves over time.

The study of movement data has happened in rather different areas, including

* transporation research, logistics
* ecology (animal movement, cells)
* crowd control
* sports
* GI Science
* Computer science
* political science (countries)

## Movement data

Movement data may come from direct, or indirect sources.

* direct: GPS, cell phone triangulation, mix (google timeline), payment transactions, public transportation check in/out, ...
   - GPS: typically sampling density is (nearly) regular, and dense (what is dense enough?)
   - others: sparse sampling, large gaps: interpolation?
* indirect: e.g. from video footage or wind fields: object tracking
   - identify objects (overlap, shade)
   - track them through imagery / raster maps

## Types of movement

* continuous: rigid objects
* split/merge: countries, rivers, depressions, storms
* discontinuous: e.g. the capital of Germany

## Questions related to movement data

* where was (is) person $x$ at time $t$?
* did persons $x$ and $y$ meet in time interval $T$? (alibi problem)
* how does a crowd behave? what is the critical density of a crowd?
* given a trajectory $q$, what is the home range of animal $Q$? (utilization distribution)
* on which road am I driving? (map matching) $\Rightarrow$ where am I?
* given a set of trajectories, on which roads can one drive, in which way? How are roads connected?
* transport and logistics: when should the bus leave / how do I optimize a transportation system?
* how do I describe the interactions between moving agents
* what is the activity/transportation mode of person $x$ at time $t$? (at home, at work, biking, running, car, bus, ...)
